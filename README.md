# Personal Encryptor Command Line Interface (CLI)
A basic command line utility to generate private/public key pairs and encrypt/decrypt data without having to know the inner workings of the crypto libraries.

This project is heavily based on sample code generated by Stephen Haunts (https://stephenhaunts.com) during his Practical Cryptography in .NET course (https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-cryptography-dotnet/table-of-contents).

You can read more about my reasoning behind this project in my blog post (https://www.onthefencedevelopment.com/whatsapp-a-haven-for-paedophiles-and-terrorists/) as well as any posts relating to it's creation and ongoing development (https://www.onthefencedevelopment.com/tag/personalencryptorcli/).

## Usage ##

### Generate Key Pair ###
In order to use any encryption system you will need to generate a Key Pair consisting of a Public and Private key. The public key can be freely distibuted but the private key must be protected from loss and unauthorised access. 

> If you lose your private key then you will not be able to decrypt messages sent to you that were encrypted using the matching private key.

>If someone else gains access to your private key then they will be able to read any data you have encrypted with it or data someone has encrypted with your public key (providing they also have access to the corresponding public keys that is).

#### Options ####

Action | Option | Notes
-------|--------|-------
generatekeys | | Signals CLI to generte a key pair
|| name | The name prefix for the key pair
|| keylength | The bit length of the keys to generate, defaults to 2048
|| output | The output path for the keys, if the folder does not exist it will be created

To generate a new Key Pair:

```C:\> PersonalEncryptorCLI generatekeys --name Alice --output C:\Users\Alice\MyKeys```

This command will result in a Private/Public Key Pair called AlicePrivateKey.xml and AlicePublicKey.xml being created in C:\Users\Alice\MyKeys

> It is highly recommended that the private key be moved to a secure location, separate from the public key.
